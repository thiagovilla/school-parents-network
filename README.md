# School-Parents Network

#todo short description

⚠️ _Warning_: this is a portfolio project and therefore has limited features.

## Idea

A web app that connects school staff, students, and parents. Each classroom has its micro-site with news feed and forum. Parents can subscribe to individual feeds. Teachers and parents can talk in private. It's an evolution of my YCMD's 2005 award.

## Goal

- Learn (relearn?) and make something in ASP.Net (in C#)
- Make something with the "Microsoft stack" from top to bottom
- Redo and evolve my YCMD 2005 award - #todo link to the award

## Stack

- ASP.Net Core 5.0 (in C#)
- Fabric Core 11.0 ([Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui) for web w/o React)
- #todo deploy on Azure

## Features

## Creative Process

## Changelog

## Roadmap
